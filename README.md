# First_Prototype
This is my first trial of developing Game.
Obstacle Game is a 3d Game developed in Unity 3d Game Engine.
To play the game open the car project.exe file.
To Download the project "DownlaodThis.zip" file is there.

About the Game:
Player has to reach the of the Ramp without touching any of the obstalce came in between. If touched then the character body will not move.
No Problem I gave Cheats to the game which i will tell you later down.
Obstacles are Cannons, LandMines, Gaint Pendulum, Lasers Blizaards and last Drone.

Control of this game:
Player can control the character with WASD/ArrowKeys for movements, C for crouch and Space for jump.
In case of fall by touching Obstacles you can press the cheat key for respawn. Keys are from 1 to 7 were you can relocate the character at point before the obstacle you fall.
Example - Incase you fall from laser then by pressing 5 you will relocate in front of laser point not from the begining of the game.
I have also created the cheat for Invincibility by pressing 0. (Nothing will happen to character).

About the files of the game:
I have uploaded the scripts folder with all the scripts and Prefab folder containg all the prefabs used in this game.
for playing this game just open the executable file and enjoy.

Things which are incomplete in this project are like Menu for pause and restart, after you reach the last stage of game only ending audio will be played and some fireworks means end is also not yet complete. And the main thing levels this was only one level game i will try to create many other levels with more difficult obstacles.
Assets which are downloaded form asset store is Standard Asset. I used the third person character and some particles System for lasers, I have given a ragdoll physics to this character for fall of the character. 

I hope this information is helpfull for players who want to play or create games.
